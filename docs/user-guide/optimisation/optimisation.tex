\chapter{Optimisation}

One of the most frequently asked questions when performing almost any scientific
computation is: how do I make my simulation faster? Or, equivalently, why is my
simulation running so slowly?

The spectral element method is no exception to this rule. The purpose of this
chapter is to highlight some of the easiest parameters that can be tuned to
attain optimum performance for a given simulation.

Details are kept as untechnical as possible, but some background information on
the underlying numerical methods is necessary in order to understand the various
options available and the implications that they can have on your simulation.

\section{Collections}
The Collections library adds optimisations to perform certain elemental
operations collectively by applying an operator using a matrix-matrix operation,
rather than a sequence of matrix-vector multiplications. Certain operators
benefit more than other from this treatment, so the following implementations
are available:
\begin{itemize}
    \item StdMat: Perform operations using collated matrix-matrix type elemental
        operation.
    \item SumFac: Perform operation using collated matrix-matrix type sum
        factorisation operations.
    \item IterPerExp: Loop through elements, performing matrix-vector operation.
    \item NoCollections: Use the original LocalRegions implementation to
        perform the operation.
\end{itemize}
All configuration relating to Collections is given in the \inltt{COLLECTIONS}
Xml element within the \inltt{NEKTAR} XML element.

\subsection{Default implementation}
The default implementation for all operators may be chosen through
setting the \inltt{DEFAULT} attribute of the \inltt{COLLECTIONS} XML
element to one of \inltt{StdMat}, \inltt{SumFac}, \inltt{IterPerExp},
\inltt{NoCollection} or \inltt{Matrixfree}. The \inltt{StdMat} sets up
a stanard matrix for the element in the collection as the underlying
operator. The following uses the collated matrix-matrix type elemental
operation for all operators and expansion orders:

\begin{lstlisting}[style=XmlStyle]
<COLLECTIONS DEFAULT="StdMat" />
\end{lstlisting}

The \inltt{NoCollection} option iterates over each expansion
in the local region calling the lcoal operator which is implemented in
a sum factorisation method within the element. The \inltt{IterPerExp}
holds a standard expansion and then also holds an expanded copy of the
geometric factors wihtin the collection operator. \inltt{SumFac} is a
sum factorisation implementation which undertakes each direction of
the method over multiple elements in the collection. Finally
\inltt{MatrixFree} implements a vectorisation suitable version of the
sum factorisation which has minimal memory movement but requires some
intial data re-orientation when vectorising over multiple elements. 

\subsection{Auto-tuning}
The choice of implementation for each operator, for the given mesh and
expansion orders, can be selected automatically through 
auto-tuning. To enable this, add the following to the \nekpp session
file:

\begin{lstlisting}[style=XmlStyle]
<COLLECTIONS DEFAULT="auto" />
\end{lstlisting}

This will collate elements from the given mesh and given expansion orders,
run and time each implementation strategy in turn, and select the fastest
performing case. Note that the selections will be mesh- and order- specific.
The selections made via auto-tuning are output if the \inltt{--verbose}
command-line switch is given.

\subsection{Manual selection and the --writeoptfile command line option}
The choice of implementation for each operator may also be set
manually within the \inltt{COLLECTIONS} tag as shown in the following
example. Different implementations may be chosen for different element
shapes and expansion orders.  Specifying \inltt{*} for \inltt{ORDER}
sets the default implementation for any expansion orders not explicity
defined.

\begin{lstlisting}[style=XmlStyle]
<COLLECTIONS>
    <OPERATOR TYPE="BwdTrans">
        <ELEMENT TYPE="T" ORDER="*"   IMPTYPE="IterPerExp" />
        <ELEMENT TYPE="T" ORDER="1-5" IMPTYPE="StdMat" />
    </OPERATOR>
    <OPERATOR TYPE="IProductWRTBase">
        <ELEMENT TYPE="Q" ORDER="*"   IMPTYPE="SumFac" />
    </OPERATOR>
</COLLECTIONS>
\end{lstlisting}

Manual selection is intended to document the optimal selections on a given
hardware platform after  prior testing, to avoid the need to run the
auto-tuning for each run.

A related option is the \inltt{--writeoptfile} command line option which
will run the auto-tuning method on section file \inltt{session.xml}
and then write out a file called \inltt{session\_opt.xml} containing a
\inltt{COLLECTIONS} xml section. If run in parallel it will write out
the root partition details but will also include any elements not on
the root partition. This XML section can hten be included in teh
original \inltt{sessoin.xml} file which can then be run wihout the
--writeoptfile command line option.


\subsection{Collection size}
The maximum number of elements within a single collection can be
enforced using the \inltt{MAXSIZE} attribute.
